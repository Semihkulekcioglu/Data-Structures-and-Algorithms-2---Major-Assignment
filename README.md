The 12 sequential problems involve tasks such as finding longest subsequences, computing sums and sequences, and sorting arrays. Techniques like dynamic programming, recursion, and sorting algorithms are commonly used to solve them efficiently. These problems require careful analysis and algorithmic insight to devise effective solutions.
